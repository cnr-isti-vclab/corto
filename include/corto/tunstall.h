/* SIMPLEST TUNSTALL encoding:
   1) build dictionary:
	  split root, keep track of highest probability, keep splitting until all words are assigned.
	  the final structure for decompression is 2 tables:
		1) index table block -> start in the second table (length is derived from next word start)
		2) words: all the words one after the other
	  structure for compression is 1 table:
	  256 entries (8bit) mapping
		if(lenght < 8bit) maps beginning of the word to length (6 bit e.g.) and code
		else maps to second 8bit table with same approach. each entry longer than 8 bits gets another table.
	  all tables are just concatenated.
